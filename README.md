To-Do App
OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to develop a responsive and interactive To-Do application that helps users efficiently manage daily tasks by adding, completing, and deleting tasks, while practicing core front-end web development skills.

STEPS PERFORMED

Designed the application structure using HTML, including task input fields and separate sections for pending and completed tasks.

Styled the user interface with CSS, implementing a modern dark theme, animations, responsive tables, and mobile-friendly layouts.

Implemented application logic using JavaScript to handle task creation, completion, deletion, and real-time rendering.

Integrated localStorage to persist pending and completed tasks across browser sessions.

Added smooth animations and interactive hover effects to enhance user experience.

Tested the application for responsiveness, functionality, and data persistence.

OUTCOME

The final result is a fully functional To-Do Web Application with a clean interface, responsive design, and persistent task management.
